It would be an egregious oversight not to explore the plot of the video game _Bioshock_ when exploring the intersection of neoliberalism, libertarianism, the deep ocean trenches, technology, knowledge and dystopia. It is, to my mind, one of the finest narrative explorations of this topic in any medium. Enter the city of Rapture, a submerged haven for those seeking to be free of regulation or legal control in the depths by fleeing the surface to an interwar Randian gulch.[1] The oligarchic founder of the city made it the founding creed that "a man is entitled to the sweat of his own brow".

The game is undoubtedly one of the finest of the 21st century i assessed purely in term of the ideas that it encapsulated. It shows that nobody can escape into the ocean (or into space) in search of a utopian place free of the old rules and conventions, for human nature will follow no matter how far the privileged few flee.

_Bioshock_ is also an excellent example of a morality tale built around the pillaging and exploitation of the deep ocean bed. The ruin of rapture, a mutagenic compound known in the game as ADAM, is found within a previously unknown species of sea slugs harvested in the deep. When commercialized and mass produced as addictive tonics that promise miraculous powers, it quickly sets the seed for a tale of civil war, science gone wrong and the consequences of commerce without regulation.

In a process that defies irony, the wealthy and privileged continue to keep the libertarian dream of ocean bed living alive, be it floating Randian seasteadings in international waters free from regulation or accountability to renewed dreams of a city under the ocean.[2] 

As with vertical real estate, the lure of 'unused' space to capital is inexorable. As buildings climb higher, imaginations delve lower. And yet, as this book explores elsewhere, the greatest libertarian reaches of imagination lie beyond orbit. In all of these cases very real physical challenges - crushing pressure, airlessness, expense, the lack of a magnetosphere - are waved away in the idealist conviction that big ideas distort space and time. The bathysphere used to descend is a Jobsian Reality Distortion Field.
