At the bottom of the ocean where all life from the sun ends, more life still abounds. Even in the harshest places for *human* life, other forms of life are possible. The distraction of unilineal technological evolution threatens to overshadow the lessons learned from the deep. In the deep trenches of the ocean, the heat of the Earth creates new life out of the reach of the sun. Like all things in the ocean and in deep mapping, meaning exists beyond sight where interactions take place outside and in excess of orderly narrative. However, despite their separation from surface life, these spaces are not immune from larger patterns of alteration or intervention:

>Apart from the phenomena associated with climate change, marine benthic ecosystems are exposed to human activities and disturbances, including several types of pollution with impacts on a global scale. Enough evidence has accumulated to demonstrate that the “remote” deep sea and the Antarctic have—in spite of their long-thought status as pristine environments— not remained unaffected. Using nematode and copepod communities, Stark et al. studied spatial variation and human impacts at Casey Station in East Antarctica. They found that these communities respond strongly to their immediate environment, and to large spatial scale contrasts.[^1]

Despite these limitations, the most alien place on planet Earth still produces life. Even the place that would seem the deadest to human eyes is fecund. Even the energy source that consumes the attention of human striving - the sun - is not required for life. Attempts to deep map the ocean depths should span disciplines and capture the strange variety of asolar life that clusters around deep sea vents, thrives in places where the human senses fail. Attempting to quantify the deep is also an attempt to disenchant the ocean. Capturing this magic through the emergent and polyvocal properties of deep maps is a vibrant method well suited for our times. The forget at the core of the Earth bleeds from its skin, seeding life and non-human interactions.
