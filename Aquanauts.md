>The journey of man into the sea has been long and productive. The current levels of technology have made some of the traditional functions of divers and aquanauts obsolete, but in the process, the ocean science community has left much of the public interest and curiosity behind. While governments are concentrating their slim and declining resources on the most streamlined and efficient means of attaining the information necessary for science to support policy, the private sector seems ready, visionary, and dedicated to bringing humankind back into the sea. May the aquanaut swim again and tell her stories many times to many audiences.[^1]

I find this paragraph troubling, but also agree with it. It bears further scrutiny. It is true that new aquanaut explorers and public science interpreters could have a powerful effect in a time when the interest in and romance of ocean science has waned. It is also true that allowing the private section to interpret the story of the ocean for a popular audience also gives carte blance for a range of misdirections and bluewashing tactics. Bringing humans back to the sea would provide more scrutiny of activities such as plastic pollution, biodiversity loss, acidification or mining. 

On the other hand, allowing capital to shape our relationship with the ocean is a trap. This article actively and effectively compares ocean exploration with space exploration and the narratives told there. This immediately raises the spectre of Elon Musk and his effective peddling of utopian hype coupled with self-enrichment and political interference. His effective use of techno-optimism - we will have self-driving cars, we will control machines with our mind, we will go to Mars - has disguised his right wing techno-authoritarian instincts for many years. Suspending disbelief when entrepreneurs and capitalists give money to enable more ocean science by a generation of new aquanauts may seem like a pragmatic trade-off for renewed attention, but it is also the weaving of a spell that hides the urge to make space and procure rare earth minerals for profit.
