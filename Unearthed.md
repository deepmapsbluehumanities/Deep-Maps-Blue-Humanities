What will happen when all of the secrets of the ocean need are unearthed? When the obscuring penumbra of water disappears and the machine eyes of humanity can see what lies there? There is a very real possibility that it will be simply more of the same: a barren necroregion stifled, boiled and acidified into nothingness by anthropogenic climate change. The romance of a strange dark hidden world dissolved for a disappointing garbage patch of waste and folly.

How much of the desire to reveal depth is based on hubristic notions of ownership? Not just resources and infrastructure, but ownership of what is permitted to be a mystery. Mysteries are dangerous and the rising ocean is certainly dangerous, both physically as they errode and immerse and epistemically as they challenge a comprehensive tech-driven solution to global heating. What is laid bare by bathymetry and remote sensing is not only a lacuna but a chastening source of perspective. Many cultures are content to tell stories of an otherworld beneath the ocean, part of the same thought world and yet apart. The ability, however limited, to where this world and to take the surface with us has thrilled oceanographers.
