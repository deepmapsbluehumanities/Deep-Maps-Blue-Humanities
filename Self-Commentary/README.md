# Self Commentary

At first glance, a book that comments upon its own text seems a dizzying ==mise en abyme=={Q1549285} regression. Delving into the multitudes contained within all books - their contradictions, their blind spots and lacunae - is intimidating. All scholarly books contain a great roiling mass of ideas hidden beneath a placid surface. They lurk unresolved beneath their facade. The conventions of academic niceties such as rigour, polish, jargon and shared scholarly vocabulary lead to genres of description such as 'magisterial' or 'erudite' are attempts to asset order over chaos, a scientific approach to a deeply ascienctific, raw and creative process.

Some writers approach their craft like a ==Fordist=={Q466969} assembly line - maximise utility, streamline literature review, automate citation, align ideas, create a steady output of maximally utilitarian publications. Their publications are prolific, impeccable, orderly and consistent. They can even be engagingly written and creative in their own specific way. Their approach is order. Their approach benefits from automation wherever possible.

There is an opposite approach focused on chaos. Both approaches meet in the middle and result in structured readable text. Both approaches are a form of gardening, but one results in well trimmed hedges and ordered beds, the other in a blooming profusion of disordered colour. This chaos-based approach benefits from ordered technology aligning disordered content. It exposes content rather than ordering it. The protean Promethean fire of creative writing is unfocused creativity. It bursts from the mind like a wellspring. It is highly personal, inflected by personality, neuro diversity, culture and personal preference.

This book is an explosion of my creative energy, inconsistently tapped but deployed through the structural affordances of technology. As creative technologists become more powerful in their practice, more creative combinations of ordered and disordered writing are possible.

This book comments upon itself because text cannot tell the story that I wish to tell. The supporting materials here are not appendices to the book. They are the book. Only text and paratext, content and commentary upon content, can create the hydra-headed story that I wish to tell.

I promise you both order and disorder, chaos and cohesion, research and creative practice. This book, in every sense, is an expression of the fierce and undying hope that digital humanities practice and experimental publishing can add to the much-needed bibliodiversity of academic writing in a time of crisis.
