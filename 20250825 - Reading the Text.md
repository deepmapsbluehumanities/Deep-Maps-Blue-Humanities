I am in a process of arranging Juncture essays (see sample essay above) inside a cloud of deep mapped media items (see Tapestry sample above).

Note that this book is a hybrid of scholarly argumentation and a deep map - it is written for a range of audiences. As a result, it may not exhibit any of the expected norms of academic writing. It is an experiment, but one that will be assisted by your expert input.

**It consists of three components:**

1. Text fragments of c.500 words in length
2. Media items within this text (e.g. references, popovers exploring terms and people mentioned in the text, images, maps, galleries) - see Juncture user guide above.
3. A Tapestry canvas containing embeds of the text fragments AND a wide range of media content - videos, images articles, etc.

The final result will exist online, but also captured and archived sustainably and shared through the content management system of its publisher ([University of Westminster Press](https://uwestminsterpress.co.uk/)). In the future, extracts of the project may be gathered in print.

**What this review is about:**

1. Suggestions for additional ideas, additional text sections, supporting resource. Note that the majority of 'references' in a traditional sense will not appear in the text, except where directly cited. They will surround the text in juxtaposition (see Tapestry sample above) - they can be suggested, and I can add them
2. Lacunae - note that there are currently deliberate lacunae in the text sample that I will be filling with more small blocks as the mapping process begins. I am interested in exploring unexpected (or expected) juxtapositions and writing new content to match
3. Suggestions about spatial positioning of supporting items (see [Tapestry sample](https://tapestries.media/t/793a0425-136f-40b1-bf38-dc9094f80c7c)) and broader ideas about representing the text spatially - the model is a vertical continuum descending through layers of text and reading
4. Suggestions about Juncture elements appearing in-line (maps, reference material) - see Juncture user guide
