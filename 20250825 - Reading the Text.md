I am in a process of arranging Juncture essays (see sample essay above) inside a cloud of deep mapped media items (see Tapestry sample above).

Note that this book is a hybrid of scholarly argumentation and a deep map - it is written for a range of audiences. As a result, it may not exhibit any of the expected norms of academic writing. It is an experiment, but one that will be assisted by your expert input. There are many design considerations that will benefit from your collected expertise.

**It consists of three components:**

1. Text fragments of c.500 words in length
2. Media items within this text (e.g. references, popovers exploring terms and people mentioned in the text, images, maps, galleries) - see Juncture user guide above.
3. A Tapestry canvas containing embeds of the text fragments AND a wide range of media content - videos, images articles, etc.

**It is best to imagine this publication as something between a large, extended and annotated essay, a deep map and a small monograph in the style of short-format publications that have been trialled by several publishers.**

The final result will exist online, but also captured and archived sustainably and shared through the content management system of its publisher ([University of Westminster Press](https://uwestminsterpress.co.uk/)). It will be gathered together, archived and presented as a digital publication via Fulcrum: ([https://www.fulcrum.org/]) In the future, extracts of the project may be gathered in print.

**What this review is about:**

1. Suggestions for additional ideas, additional text sections, supporting resource. Note that the majority of 'references' in a traditional sense will not appear in the text, except where directly cited. They will surround the text in juxtaposition (see Tapestry sample above) - they can be suggested, and I can add them to the Tapestry
2. Lacunae - note that there are currently deliberate lacunae in the text sample that I will be filling with more small blocks as the mapping process begins. I am interested in exploring unexpected (or expected) juxtapositions and writing new content to match
3. Suggestions about spatial positioning of supporting items (see [Tapestry sample](https://tapestries.media/t/793a0425-136f-40b1-bf38-dc9094f80c7c)) and broader ideas about representing the text spatially - the model is a vertical continuum descending through layers of text and reading
4. Suggestions about Juncture elements appearing in-line (maps, reference material) - see Juncture user guide

See the [peer review guide](https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/deep-maps-peer-review/release/1) above for instructions about how to leave feedback within Github. This is experimental and as a result all comments are welcome.
