# Violet Black

Water confounds even when it flows over national borders that can in principle be delineated. The ocean may be traced over with economic zones, maritime borders and trade routes, but it eternally evades neat classifications of ownership. As Stacy Alaimo points out, this ungovernability only increases the further one descends. They are beyond human control, largely beyond human vision, and contain life beyond easy study or classification. The oceans exceed the stories we tell of them, and are a lacuna that can never be filled. 

> Even as deep-sea creatures have been brought to the surface, it remains convenient to assume that the bathyal, abyssal, and hadal zones are empty, void, null-an abyss of con­cern. The deep seas epitomize how most ocean waters exist beyond state borders, legal protection, and cultural imaginaries.[^1]

The convenience of assuming emptiness conceals the inconvenience of the reality: a sheer excess of material beyond human sight, control or imagining. Modern humanistic studies of the ocean explore presence rather than absence - rich and complex histories, webs of the human and non-human, assemblages, biodiversity, strangeness, familiary and estrangement - and yet the experimental nature of this book strives at all times to exceed presence and move into the realm of excess. It is a product of *too much*: too much emotion, too much depth, too many perspectives, too many mysteries, too many poorly understood climate realities, too much or hyper objectivity. Because it is a book in excess, it leaks. Out of chapters, out of paragraphs, out of the strictures of covers, arguments and text blocks. Technology provides a flexible and capacious mode for controlling this excess and ungovernable epistemic chaos and commenting upon it. This task is eccentric and quixotic, but it is not the ambition of this piece to evade these labels. It is gloriously incoherent, bulging at the seams, leaking and dissolving, swirling and shifting. It is a violet-black archive, a dark web of content, a bathymetric foray into the hostile and alien. It is a sounding of depth that can never reach the bottom.
