# Enframed
Cartography enframes the ocean, bringing rigidity, control and order. It becomes quantified and demystified, policed and governed. It is owned. By seeing the deeps through an instrumentalist resource, it becomes inert. By becoming inert, it becomes unproblematic. By becoming unproblematic, it becomes a resource. Melody Jue sees the technical enframing of the ocean - through technology, through measurement, through sensing, through digital service-based interaction - as a long techno-scientific process:

> To see the ocean in terms of a technical object (the clock) foreshadows how science sees the ocean as a genetic database today; the database is simply a newer technology to enframe the workings of the ocean. The blankness of the sea in Google Ocean remains as an invitation to control, echoing the grid aesthetic that emerged in seventeenth-century mapping practices. However, the fact that each of the “layers” populates the ocean with a number of icons suggests a kind of hybrid form, merging the earlier sea-monster populated maps and the advent of the grid aesthetic.[^1]

By measuring the ocean and viewing it from above through the eyes of satellites and the abstraction of mapping platforms - and even more sophisticated methods such as GIS - the water becomes a substrate for human activities. It becomes a database, a resource, a series of mountains and valleys to be mined, a new frontier for the manifest destiny of the human race.
