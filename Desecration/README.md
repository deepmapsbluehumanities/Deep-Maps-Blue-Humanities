# Desecration

>The concept of “Oceanian Sovereignty” suggests therefore that governance or management action should be perceived, conceived, and engaged as a common enactment between partners which may overlap with but not be defined by the national or international governance framework whose agents and agencies are seeking to enact DSM. One of the most delicate issues confronting any governance or management context is the establishment of who can determine environmental and ecological futures and make decisions (Mawyer and Jacka, 2018).[^1]

Deep sea mining may appear at first to be a 'victimless crime', the opening up of access to a previously untouchable space filled with riches. The *terra nullius* narrative of colonial imagination continues to play out, desecrating both the patrimony of island dwelling and coastal peoples but also the biodiversity and life on which human life depends. There is a need for nuance in the relationship between those with a stake in oceanic life, and a reciprocal agency that recognises a spectrum of agencies from human to non-human. As the ocean bed is uncovered and demystified and more land is revealed beneath, it is inevitable within capitalism that what can be exploited will be exploited. Sovereignty takes on new depth in this context, literally and figuratively. What previously recognised the rights to the surface and upper depths - navigation, fishing, legal jurisdiction becomes all the more crucial when the full vertical reality of the deep see manifests itself.
